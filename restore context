restorecon = restore context command
Basically, the restorecon command will base on the current folder location to set (restore) the appropriate context for the file placed inside. 
This command requires root privilege to run. Imagine if an adversary managed to place a harmful repository definition file in this folder, the added repository 
will not work as its context is incompatible in this folder.
